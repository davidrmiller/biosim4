/********************************************************************************
This function does a neural net feed-forward operation, from sensor (input) neurons
through internal neurons to action (output) neurons. The feed-forward
calculations are evaluated once each simulator step (simStep).

There is no back-propagation in this simulator. Once an individual's neural net
brain is wired at birth, the weights and topology do not change during the
individual's lifetime.

The data structure Indiv::neurons contains internal neurons, and Indiv::connections
holds the connections between the neurons.

We have three types of neurons:

     input sensors - each gives a value in the range SENSOR_MIN.. SENSOR_MAX (0.0..1.0).
         Values are obtained from getSensor().

     internal neurons - each takes inputs from sensors or other internal neurons;
         each has output value in the range NEURON_MIN..NEURON_MAX (-1.0..1.0). The
         output value for each neuron is stored in Indiv::neurons[] and survives from
         one simStep to the next. (For example, a neuron that feeds itself will use
         its output value that was latched from the previous simStep.) Inputs to the
         neurons are summed each simStep in a temporary container and then discarded
         after the neurons' outputs are computed.

     action (output) neurons - each takes inputs from sensors or other internal
         neurons; In this function, each has an output value in an arbitrary range
         (because they are the raw sums of zero or more weighted inputs).
         The values of the action neurons are saved in local container
         actionLevels[] which is returned to the caller by value (thanks RVO).
