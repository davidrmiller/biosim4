# biosim4.ini
# biosim4.ini is the default config file for the simulator.
# The config filename is determined in simulator() in simulator.cpp.
# The config file is parsed by class ParamManager, see params.cpp and params.h.
# Although not foolproof, the config file can be modified during a simulation
# run and the param manager will make any new params available to the simulator
# after the end of the current simulator step or after the end of the current
# generation.
#
# Parameter values can also be changed automatically based on the current generation
# number of the simulation using the syntax (see barrierType param for example): 
# <parameterName>@<generationNumber> = <newValue>
# Instances of the same parameter have to be ascending by generation number to work
# correctly, e.g. barrierType@100 must be later in the file than barrierType@50, 
# which in turn must come after barrierType. Not all parameters can be safely
# changed during a simulation. Some restrictions are noted below.
